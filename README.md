# Users
    1. Since, the main purpose of this assignment is not to create users(through signing up and all), I just created to create some system for some identity of the user, which involve the input of their name and some id(anything they enter). The combination of these two are expected to be unique but it might not be. Again, this assignment main purpose is not related to this, so let us just consider this for the time being.
