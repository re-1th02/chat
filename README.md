# Users
    1. Since, the main purpose of this assignment is not to create users(through signing up and all), I just created to create a system for an identity of the user, which involve the input of their name and some id(anything they enter). The combination of these two are expected to be unique but it might not be. Again, this assignment main purpose is not related to this, so let us just consider this for the time being.

    2. Create User:
        Enter name and id and click create user.
        This creates a user if the combination of name and id doesn't overlap with other.
    3. Access User:
        Enter name and id and click access user.
        This access the user if created earlier.
    4. Load Messages:
        clicking the button "Load Previous Msgs", loads all previous messages.
    5. The user's messages are black-backgrounded.
